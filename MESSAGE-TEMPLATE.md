## Subject: Mama Mind Project Setup - Get Your API Keys ðŸš€

Hey team!

Welcome to the Mama Mind project! To get started developing, you'll need to set up your own Supabase API keys. This keeps our production data safe while giving you full development access.

### ðŸ”‘ Why Your Own Keys?
- **Safe**: Your development won't affect production
- **Free**: Supabase free tier is perfect for development  
- **Independent**: Work at your own pace without conflicts

### ðŸ“‹ Quick Setup Process (10 minutes):

1. **Follow this guide**: [DEVELOPER-API-SETUP.md](./DEVELOPER-API-SETUP.md)
2. **Create your own free Supabase project**
3. **Get your API keys** 
4. **Configure environment variables**
5. **Start developing!**

### ðŸš€ Commands to Remember:

```bash
# Setup environment files
npm run env:setup

# Test your configuration  
npm run env:test

# Start development (frontend + backend)
npm run dev:check
```
